# simplest todo system

## front-end:
  whatevet it is

## back-end:
  C++ based server

## testing system:
  automated api testing
  stress test
  performance logging (time costed)
  visualized outputs
  authentication

## how to get started
```shell
curl -fsSL https://xmake.io/shget.text | bash
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
cd todo
xmake
xmake run
```

## steps
### step one:
  prepare basic structs & DB storage
### step two:
  a very simple UI
### step three:
  add a basic testing system
### step four:
  performance optimization (reduce copying | multi-thread | memory caching)
### step five:
  visualized performance benchmark system (functions cost time | memory & cpu profiling)
### step six:
  stressed test system
### step seven:
  authentication (some basic passwords)
### step eight:
  make a better UI !
